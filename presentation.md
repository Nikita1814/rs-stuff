3. Transcript (more of a list of notes- a rough retelling of what I said)
What is Scrum ?
It is a software development methodology allegedly created to facilitate agile development and support its 12 principles  
Here you can see the aforementioned 12 principles however to be brief I will not read them all out but summarize them as pertaining to the idea that  the product should not be developed as a complete whole in accordance with a rigid yet straightforward plan, but should be finished and hopefully shown to the end  users  in chunks allowing for  feedback and thus creating an opportunity to adapt  the product  to the change in technology and demand.  

 At the beginning of the development process Instead of a rigid and straightforward plan a so-called project backlog is composed – a priority list of features each feature is described in the form of a card or user story, on the slide you may see one model of organizing one such user story  . 
After the preliminary planning is complete the working process is divided into multiple “sprints” small 1-3 week timeframes during which the features are picked out according to priority and then are subjected to a complete  development cycle (plan-build-test-review) resulting in what is called a “potentially shippable product” which is then presented to the stakeholders and employers for them to either judge it complete or to decide to continue the development for another sprint
On the course of a sprint  3 ceremonies take place – first the composition of the sprint backlog, then during the development process itself the daily meetings ( called daily scrums) where the progress, potential problems and implementation are discussed and finally a sprint review  - a retrospective overview of the work accomplished during the sprint a sort of  and larger final daily scrum 
 The Good:
It gets the job done in the quickest timeframe – each sprint results in a potentially shippable product, allowing the product owners to stop the development process as soon as they would wish it and ship  the product
Keeps the stakeholders happy  -  product owners and employers are able to observe the continued development as see results
(allegedly) allows for feedback input and modification  - during each sprint review and each sprint meeting backlogs may be modified 
The individual effort of each team member is visible during daily scrum meetings
Simplifies the management  - Large projects are divided into small easily manageable chunks, the entire process is practically automatic, the results are clearly observable through charts and cards, the input of each team member can be easily monitored
The Bad:
Scope Creep – the end-date is rarely defined the project can keep growing spontaneously and potentially infinitely
“We’ll finish it later” or the infinitely growing sprint backlog – some features may be difficult to divide into smaller chunks or implement thus increasing the individual sprint backlogs and prolonging development 
Disappearance of team members or “Lack of commitment”  may hurt badly 

The Ugly: 
Quantity  and speed over quality – 
good design is rarely given the priority, the product needs to be completed as soon and as efficiently as possible, personal input and involvement are discouraged, developers are rarely given time to think the structure of the project over instead being forced to right away start doing short daily tasks as one programmer described it “instead of setting up proper lighting we have to navigate a cave with a blowtorch”
Developers are tools not people or the art of automated conveyor belt of suffering
The system allows for managers to avoid day to day management on the one hand, but constantly pressure torment and otherwise “motivate” their employees with constant meetings, mind-numbing charts and various reporting documentation, 
Developers are treated as sheep to be herded – simple tools encouraged to perform their job quickly and efficiently
The system discourages personal input Stifles creativity completely depersonalizes the project reducing the work process to simply ticking boxes

It violates some of the agile principles notably
1.	Adaptation and change are discouraged by the rigid structure, team flexibility highly detrimental
2.	the system is designed to automate management thus making the "bringing people together" idea superficial at best
3.	Sprints are the antithesis of sustainable pace
4.	Speed over creativity renders the technical brilliance point moot
